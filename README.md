# Portfolio_Optimization_-_Price_Forecasting
Portfolio Optimization using Mean Variance, Black Litterman, Monte Carlo, Risk Parity, Maximum Entropy, Grey Wolf, Particle Swarm optimzation techniques and price forecasting using ARIMA, LSTM model. 

I prepared an extensive Python project focused on portfolio optimization and price forecasting. For portfolio optimization, I used a variety of techniques including Mean-Variance optimization, the Black-Litterman model, Monte Carlo simulation, Risk Parity, Maximum Entropy, Grey Wolf Optimizer, and Particle Swarm Optimization. Each of these methods offers a unique approach to determining the optimal asset allocation, balancing returns, and risks.

Additionally, I implemented price forecasting models to predict future price movements. This involved using both ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. ARIMA is a popular time series forecasting method that captures various aspects of the data, such as trends and seasonality. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, excels at learning long-term dependencies and patterns in time series data, making it well-suited for financial forecasting.

The combination of these optimization techniques and forecasting models provides a robust framework for effective portfolio management. By leveraging both traditional financial models and advanced machine learning techniques, I aimed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of investment strategies, ultimately helping to achieve better financial outcomes.
